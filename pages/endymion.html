          <p>John Keats (1795&#8211;1821) is considered to be one of England’s greatest poets along with the likes of Wordsworth and Spenser. And this in just the 25 years that he lived (imagine if he’d lived till the ripe old age of 90). He wrote all his major poems in the last four to five years of his life.</p>
         <p>When we read about Keats as a Romantic poet, (which he did not like to be called as one) we cannot help but be hit by the realisation that his own life had all the hallmarks of a tragic Romantic hero&#8212;a tragic love story, a poet who wasn’t appreciated when he was alive, a fear of his works being forgotten, a short life, death away from home. Before dying, Keats expected his poetry to be forgotten, as the epitaph he wrote for his tombstone indicates: <em>“Here lies one whose name was writ in water.”</em></p>

          <div class="text">
          <p>Romanticism can be understood as a movement which was mostly an attitude or a reaction that certain people had to the quickly-changing world. during the mid-19th till the mid-19th century. These Romantic ideas still affect our attitudes towards concepts like love, beauty, life even today. One cannot define Romanticism with a start and an end point in history as one can with most literary or philosophical movements.</p> 
          <p> So what does it mean to be a Romantic? Are there simple things that make you get lost in thought and put a smile on your face—a pet, the memory of playing in a stream with your childhood best friend, the Atlas cycle of your grandfather? Congrats, you’re a Romantic.</p> 
          <p> The Romantics that we read about in Art, Philosophy, Architecture etc. are just the same—they were people who preferred nature, beauty, the past (the medieval past, mostly), the countryside over the industrial innovations, wealth, the changing present and the new industrial cities. The Romantics paid a lot of importance to childhood as well. As they saw in this the innocence of human life before it has been trained to live a certain way, think in a certain direction, taught to not question things like authority and the society. A child for them became the closest way to truly live life to its fullest.</p>

          <h4 class="subhead">The Life of Thomas Chatterton</h4>
          <p>Thomas Chatterton was a young English poet who died of suicide at the age of 17. His poems on beauty and knowledge were rejected by multiple publishers as they did not match the trends of the time. His parents were forcing him to follow law, whereas he wanted to follow his dreams of becoming a successful writer. In the end, he took the terrible step of taking his own life. To the Romantics he became a symbol of struggle that an artist goes through in a harsh, cruel world that is incapable of understanding their sensibilities. John Keats even dedicated the poem Endymion to the memory of Thomas Chatterton.</p>

          <h2 class="section-name">The Greek myth of Endmyion</h2>

            <em>Selene and Endymion</em>(c1770) by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Selene_and_Endymion_by_Ubaldo_Gandolfi.jpg">Ubaldo Gandolfi</a>, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</p></figcaption>
          <p>There are multiple versions of the story of Endymion—who he was, what he did, who his parents were etc. Different sources have different stories. Some say Zeus was the father, others do not, some say he was a King, some say he was a shepherd. We shall go, for simplicity’s sake, with the version that Zeus was his father and that he was a shepherd.
          <p> Endymion like the other humans with divine parentage wasn’t blessed with immortality or superhuman strength. He was instead blessed with divine beauty. He was so beautiful that even the titan goddess Selene, the Moon incarnate, fell in love with him. They both fall in love, but cannot live together happily ever after, because Endymion is just a mortal and would die in a few decades, whereas Selene is an immortal, and would have to live forever with the pain of losing her beloved.</p>
          <p>So she decides to do what every other god in the Greek myths did when met with an issue, that is to take it up with Zeus. Now Zeus is not in the mood to grant immortality to mortals as he is already angered with their questioning of the power of the gods, and to Endymion specifically because he doesn’t like the fact that goddesses are falling for his beauty. But I guess Zeus also couldn’t say no to Selene—what if she decides to give up her job of riding her moon chariot across the night sky? Who would do the job of lighting up the night sky then?</p>  
          <p>In the end he resigns to her wish and grants the wish. But as is typical with Zeus, he does so by granting Endymion immortality through eternal sleep.</p>
          <p>Selene didn’t complain, now she spends one night every month with her beloved on top of Mount Latmos (the one night every month that the moon is not in the night sky). Maybe Hypnos, sleep incarnate, felt bad and made him aware of Selene whenever they were together, or some other story that is lost to us, Selene had 50 daughters with him, and these 50 daughters of the moon are dedicated to the 50 months of the Olympiad. </p>
          <h4 class="subhead">Selene? Luna?</h4>
         <p>The lover of Endymion, like his parentage, is varied depending on the sources and the culture. In some versions, it is the Greek Titan Goddess of the Moon, <strong> Selene</strong>, who with her siblings, Eos and Helios are in charge of riding their chariots of the Moon, Dawn and the Sun through the sky. Other versions have the Greek Olympian <strong>Artemis</strong>  as the lover. Artemis, the Goddess of the hunt, also had the Moon under her protection (but unlike Selene, she is not directly responsible for the moon). The Roman equivalent of Selene is <strong>Luna</strong>, and of Artemis is <strong>Diana</strong>. So you might find these names as well. Keats calls Selene as <strong>Cynthia</strong>, which is another name for Diana (maybe to make it sound nicer to the English ears?)</p>
         <p>Note that the ancient Greeks never easily associated the myth of Endymion with Artemis (and the Romans with Diana) as she is known as the ever-chaste, virgin goddess. It was mostly associated with her during the Renaissance.</p>
         <p>Just understand that Endmyion was so beautiful that even the Moon fell in love with him. The Moon!</p>
